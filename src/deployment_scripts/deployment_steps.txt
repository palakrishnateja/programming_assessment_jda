*******DEPLOYMENT STEPS******
1) Code Maintainance :
	- Check-in the entire code(git_cloner.py, requirements.txt and all scripts in src directory) in a code repository like github or bigbucket - to maintain version control of the code in case if its used by other developers.
2) Deploy the code to multiple Derbian machines:
	- Options to deploy:
		1)Clone the git repository to a location on every machine using git tool
		or
		2)Manually SSH the git_cloner.py script and requirements.txt to a location on every machine using appropriate authentication
		     a) install all modules in requirements.txt
                     b) run git_cloner.py by giving correct git_url as input
3) Run start.sh
	- This shell script will 
		- Check for all packages required by running requirements.txt
		- Creates a cron job in crontab of the machine and that runs image_downloader.py every 5mins.
        	- Launches a httpserver that serves the images downloaded by image_downloader.py on the host and port provided as inputs.
